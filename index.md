* Lab 12

  I liked Lab 12, part 1 because it featured the generation of images that were layered in order to create a .gif
  animation. With this lab I was able to create code that utilized Magick to generate colors in a succession of
  iterated imagery which when put together creates a .gif with an illusion that it is moving.

* Lab 1

  I hope saying Lab 1 isn't basic because I enjoyed being able to learn something rather than nothing. I felt very
  successful being able to mess with code for the first time and utilize GitHub, a site that I never thought I would
  use frequently now. So I congratulate it for being my gateway towards exploring more towards what my major offers.

* Lab 4

  I liked Lab 4 for its integration for a fairly boring Hi-Lo guessing game that challenged me at the time to create
  something different. I don't think it's anything special today but I enjoyed being able to figure out how to fix
  the code which I thought was fine at first. It was also rewarding being able to utilize newer tools such as the make
  command, etc.
